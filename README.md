## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

My challenge was to to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).


### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, we can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of project directory to make local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives us and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, we will need to modify views/js/main.js until frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. we will find instructive comments in main.js.

we might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.

# My optimizations :-

##Part 1: To Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

1. made css/style.css inline to index.html

2. added media="print" to <link href="css/print.css" rel="stylesheet" media="print">

3. added async to javascripts.

##Part 2: To Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

1. removed forced synchronous layout.

2. Moved lines out of for loop that only needed one call to configure varibles for calculations.

3. used getElementsByClassName and getElementById instead of querySelector.

4. reduced for-loop from iterating from 200 times to 40 times in generating the sliding pizzas when the  page loads.

5. added will-change: transform to views/css/style.css

6. reduced the size of images (pizza and pizzeria).
